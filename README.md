# chromex

## Project Note
Done on Mar 10, 2022.
I took this tutorial because tealhq.com's (https://app.tealhq.com/job-tracker) job tracker interests me as it use chrome extension for job-seekers to bookmark job-ad that interest them. It's a neat idea, in all I think, it's better than huntr (https://huntr.co/).
